Voltage Measurement in Analog Circuit - Proteus Project

## Overview

This project is an analog circuit simulation created in Proteus (version 8.14). The goal is to measure the voltage inside the circuit, providing a virtual environment to understand and test voltage measurement techniques.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Proteus 8.14: [Download Link](https://www.labcenter.com/downloads/)
